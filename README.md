# Student-record-system
This is a Java program that i created that manages student records for coursework and research. It performs operations such as sorting, removing, displaying, and reporting student grades, all stored in an ArrayList and exported to a CSV file.

I made this for my ICT167 assigment, i got to experience taking on and creating a fully working system im proud to share
